*	Screenshot_1.png and Screenshot_2.png specify how the tree was created
	(because we use a function to randomly generate the tree, nothing is manual
	except for the number of vertexes and the weight range [-2]~[2]).
	So Screenshot_1.png and Screenshot_2.png are our input and output photos.

*	Screenshot_3.png is also an output photo which shows the found MST in the 3 specified situations:
	- Before adding an edge
	- After adding an edge that doesn't change the MST
	- After adding an edge that does change the MST
	
*	The output photos don't show the most right side of the output so added a text output file as well.
